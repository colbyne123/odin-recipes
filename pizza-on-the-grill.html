                    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
                        
                        <li>In a bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water, and mix in sugar. Proof 
                            for ten minutes, or until frothy</li>
                            <li>Mix in the salt, olive oil, and flour until dough pulls away
                                from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                                <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, 
                                    about 8 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Place dough in a well oiled bowel, and cover with a damp
                                        cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
                                        <li>Punch down, and knead in garlic and basil. Set aside
                                            to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.
                                        </li>
                        
                            <li>Brush grill grate with garlic flavored olive oil. Carefully place 
                            one piece of dough on hot grill. 
                        </li>
                                <li>The dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom
                            crust has lightly browned, turn the dough over using two spatulas
                        </li>
                                     <li>Working quickly, brush oil over crust, and then brush with 2 
                            tablespoons tomato sauce.
                        </li>
                                        <li>Arrange 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/8 cup sliced black olives, and 1/8
                            cup roasted red peppers over crust. 
                        </li>
                                            <li>Sprinkle with 1 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons basil. Close the lid, 
                            and cook until the cheese melts. 
                        </li>
                                                <li>Remove from the grill, and set aside to cool for a few minutes 
                            while you prepare the second pizza.
                        </li>
